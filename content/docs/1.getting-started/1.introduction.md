description: A production-ready documentation template built with Nuxt and shadcn-vue — engineered for speed, clarity, and developer sanity.

Welcome to **shadcn-docs-template**. This page exists for no reason, you can go to [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) or [Customization](/docs/getting-started/customization) for faster start.

If you still read this, then wellcome! let me Introduce my self, Hi, I'm Ebraheem Alhetari (pronounced like "Eb-ra-heem Al-he-ta-ri"). I built this documentation template (actually I copy the most of it) so that anyone can create a beautiful docs site just like it, or a batter one (if you can)!

This template is 100% open source, easy to customize, and will be kept up to date with the latest changes from [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com). Whether you're documenting your own library, project, or product, you can use this as a solid foundation.

Powered by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and the amazing Vue ecosystem, it's designed to be both developer‑friendly and a joy to read.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and build something great!

## Why This Template Exists ?

Well! you have a full and easy access to shadcn components, but it takes a lot of time to just grap the documntaion style! and this is why...

## What Happens Next

Run it locally. Modify anything. Break nothing important. Ship documentation that reads like a finished product instead of a side project.
