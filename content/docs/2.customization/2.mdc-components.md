# MDC Components

This document covers the three main custom MDC `(Markdown Components)` used in this template to seamlessly display UI component previews and their raw source code.

## ComponentPreview

The `<ComponentPreview>` (or `::component-preview` in Markdown) is the main component used to showcase UI components and their examples. It automatically renders a working interactive component alongside its source code in a tabbed interface.

### File Location
`app/components/content/ComponentPreview.vue`

### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | *(Required)* | The name of the component (e.g., `Button`). It will look for the component first in `components/demo/`, and if not found, it falls back to `components/ui/`. |
| `align` | `"center" \| "start" \| "end"` | `"center"` | Alignment of the rendered component inside the preview box. |
| `description` | `string` | `undefined` | An optional description for the component. |
| `hideCode` | `boolean` | `false` | If `true`, the "Code" tab and source code will be completely hidden, rendering only the interactive component block. |
| `class` | `HTMLAttributes["class"]` | `undefined` | Custom CSS classes applied to the root wrapper. |

### Usage

::component-preview
---
name: ButtonDemo
description: A basic button example
align: center
---
::

```markdown
::component-preview
---
name: ButtonDemo
description: A basic button example
align: center
---
::
```

Or using the shorthand inline syntax:

```markdown
::component-preview{name="ButtonDemo" align="end"}
```

::callout{type="tip"}
The `component-preview` by default looks for components in the `components/demo/` directory, and in `components/ui/`. This allows you to organize your demo components separately from your main UI components.
